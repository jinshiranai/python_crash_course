# PCC Try It Yourself 5-13. My Ideas

# 1. Vocab game.
# I want to make a game like Typing of the Dead where enemies appear and you defeat them by typing the associated words. The goal of this project is to help my junior high students with their spelling so they don't lose points on tests, because they don't get partial credit for mispellings on tests here in Japan.

# 2. Cycling data visualizer.
# I want to make an application that pulls my data from Strava and visualizes it in a more palatable way for me.

# 3. Text adventure game.
# I want to make a simple text adventure using one of my stories as a base. Most likely Arman and the Flaming Dragon. Of the three, this will probably be the one I complete first.
