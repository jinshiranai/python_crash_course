Renamed the lottery module from lottery.py to lottery_module.py.
Finished the skeleton of lottery_module.py.
Recreated lottery.py as the main lottery program.
TODO:
 - Finish the exit method so it confirms before quitting.
 - Add intro text to the main program.
 - Add lottery simulation style selection to the main program.
  


The goal of this project is to use everything that I've learned until now
to craft a lottery simulation that accepts user input and runs until they
hit the jackpot under user-decided conditions.

After winning the lottery, the program will print a summary of the simulation,
including values such as money spent, net jackpot gain/loss, and time spent
broken down into weeks and years.
