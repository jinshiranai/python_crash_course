The goal of this project is to use everything that I've learned until now
to craft a lottery simulation that accepts user input and runs until they
hit the jackpot under user-decided conditions.

After winning the lottery, the program will print a summary of the simulation,
including values such as money spent, net jackpot gain/loss, and time spent
broken down into weeks and years.
