This chapter introduces tuples, range(), and the for loop.

Also list comprehensions! I was ecstatic when list comprehensions finally clicked for me.
They're just so efficent and felt so good to write once I figured them out.

tiy4-4.py was where I started realizing just how efficent good code can make things.
Populating a list with numbers 1 through 1000000 was a easy as a few lines of code.

Though were I to do it now, I'd use the list comprehension
  millions = [value for value in range(1, 1000000)]
  to turn three lines into one.
