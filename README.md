# python_crash_course
Collection of my programs and notes working through the Python Crash Course 2nd Ed.

My first ever personal project built to cover everything I learned in the first 11 chapters of PCC:
 - [Lottery project](pcc_chapter9/lottery_sim/): A simulation of a real lottery with user-chosen runstyles.
  The README.md therein contains more detailed information!
 
For other notable projects within this repo, please check out:
 - [コロナに負けるな！/ Don't Lose to Covid! game](pcc_projects/alien_invasion): A game made using the Pygame library.
 - [Data Visualizations](pcc_chapter16): Visualizations of data pulled from CSV and JSON files.
 - [Working with APIs](pcc_chapter17): Manipulating and visualizing data pulled from APIs.
 - [Learning Logs](pcc_projects/learning_log): A live web app built with Django and Bootstrap4, and deployed with Heroku.
