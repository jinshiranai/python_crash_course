Chapter 7 covers while and input(), finally.

Since I had already taught myself while and input ahead of time, I breezed through
  this chapter. But don't take that to mean I didn't learn anything. I was unaware
  of break, and now it's part of my repertoire. I also learned that while operates
  on not just conditionals but Boolean values as well, meaning that setting "while True:"
  will run until break, and "while (variable that's set equal to True):" will run until
  that flag is False.
  
This is also the chapter when things really began to click, and I was able to
  produce code when asked without having to flip to prior pages/chapters to 
  remind myself of code I might have forgotten or check to make sure I was doing things
  right.
  
A notable program from this chapter is tiy7-5.py, where I was tasked with
  printing ticket prices according to age. I took it a step further and totaled
  those prices and announced the final price at the end of the loop.
